# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato Delivery Operations

In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Zomato's delivery operations dataset to uncover insights into delivery performance, time efficiency and external factors such as weather and traffic. 

The goal is to:
- Understand the structure and quality of the data
- Clean and preprocess the data by handling nulls, duplicates, formatting, and standardizing columns
- Analyze how various features (like traffic, vehicle condition, city, festival, etc.) affect delivery time and ratings
- Visualize patterns using plots such as bar charts, line charts, boxplots, pie charts, and correlation heatmaps

## Why EDA?

EDA is a fundamental step in any data analysis pipeline. It helps identify patterns, detect outliers, discover relationships between variables, and prepare the data for further modeling or business insights. For a company like Zomato, optimizing delivery operations directly impacts customer satisfaction and business efficiency.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available and contains detailed information about Zomato deliveries, including:

- Delivery time (in minutes)  
- Weather and traffic conditions  
- City and festival impact  
- Delivery person age, ratings, and vehicle condition  
- Order types, etc.

## 🧹 Cleaning & Preprocessing

Before diving into analysis, the dataset was cleaned using:
- Null value handling with mode/mean replacement
- Proper datetime formatting and conversion
- Column renaming for better readability
- Duplicate check and type casting

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

1. Distribution of order types and delivery time
2. Impact of traffic and weather on average delivery time
3. Ratings trend by city and delivery person age
4. Multi-variable analysis: Weather + Traffic + Festival
5. Correlation between numeric features
6. Boxplot analysis for traffic vs ratings
